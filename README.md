## Netflix Data Exploration and visualisation

In this project I have tried to explore few important questions like:
1. What type of content is available in different countries?
2. How has the number of movies released per year changed over the last 20-30 years?
3. Comparison of tv shows vs. movies.
4. What is the best time to launch a TV show?
5. Analysis of actors/directors of different types of shows/movies.
6. Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years
7. Understanding what content is available in different countries
